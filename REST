= Heroku REST API

Typically the command-line program is used for manually manipulating Heroku
apps; or from a Ruby script (like a Rakefile), one uses the Heroku::Client
class.  This document describes the underlying REST API used by both.

== Authentication

Use HTTP basic auth to provide the Heroku username (email) and password with
each request.

== Content Types

Actions that take additional input besides the verb and URL fall into two
categories: XML/formencoded, or plaintext.  Actions that take multiple input
parameters (such as updating the app settings) accept either an XML input body,
or form variables as an input body in x-www-form-urlencoded format.  Actions
that take a block of code or text data (such as uploading an ssh key) expect a
plaintext input body.

Most actions return XML, except for a few that return plaintext (such as the
output of rake).

== Resources & Actions

  GET http://heroku.com/apps

Returns XML listing of apps belonging to the user.

  POST http://heroku.com/apps

Create a new app with an untitled name.  Returns XML of app settings, including
the generated name.

  POST http://heroku.com/apps
    app[name]=:appname

Create a new app with the provided name.  Returns XML of app settings.

  GET http://heroku.com/apps/:appname

Returns XML of the app settings (the same data returned after creation).

  PUT http://heroku.com/apps/:appname

Update app settings, with input structure matching the output of the GET above.

  GET http://heroku.com/apps/:appname/collaborators

Returns XML list of collaborators (email addresses) on the app

  POST http://heroku.com/apps/:appname/collaborators
    collaborator[email]=:email

Add a new collaborator to the app.

  DELETE http://heroku.com/apps/:appname/collaborators/:email

Delete a collaborator from the app.  Don't forget to urlencode the email, since
@ signs are not valid in URLs.

  POST http://heroku.com/apps/:appname/rake

Execute a rake command on the app.  The input body should be plaintext
containing the command.  Returns a plaintext output body with the rake output.

  DELETE http://heroku.com/apps/:appname

Permanently destroy the app.

  POST http://heroku.com/user/keys

Upload an ssh public key.  The input body is plaintext containing the key
contents, usually around 200 bytes for an RSA key and 600 bytes for a DSA key.
Make sure you are uploading the public portion of the key (e.g.,
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) and not the private portion (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa).

  GET http://heroku.com/user/keys

Returns XML of user's current keys.

  DELETE http://heroku.com/user/keys/:keyname

Delete one key by its name.  The name is the portion at the end of the key,
e.g. a key like "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAlmn+I0= joe@joe-smiths-computer.local"
has a keyname of joe@joe-smiths-computer.local.  Remember to urlencode the
keyname, since @ is not a valid URL character.

== Example

Although one would normally use Heroku::Client from a Ruby program, here's some
sample code for reference.  It creates an app named foobaz by posting to /apps.

Using Net::HTTP:

  require 'net/http'

  Net::HTTP.start('heroku.com') do |http|
    request = Net::HTTP.Post.new('/apps')
    request.basic_auth 'me@example.com', 'mypass'
    res = http.request(request, 'app[name]=foobaz')
    puts res.body
  end

Using the RestClient gem:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rest_client'

  apps = RestClient::Resource.new('http://heroku.com/apps', 'me@example.com', 'mypass')
  apps.post :app => { :name => 'foobaz' }
